        <h1>Administrative & Government Affairs</h1>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Administrative Law is rapidly growing as a consequence of the increase in governmental functions. Markets and other complex forms of non-governmental administration generate enormous benefits, but also produce inefficiencies and failures, abuses of economic power and position, environmental degradation, safety hazards, economic insecurity, dependency, and other systemic ills. In response to the inadequacies of private and criminal law, legislatures have adopted extensive programs to prevent these ills.

            Corporate clients as well as some private clients require extensive advice and support for their national and international businesses from well-established GGI law firms who are at the forefront of the latest developments in Administrative Law and understand the necessity for precise assessment and meticulous preparation in all government related affairs, public procurement, government tenders or tenders put out by international organizations and entities.</p>
